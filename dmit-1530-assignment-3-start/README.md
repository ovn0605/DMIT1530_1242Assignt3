For the complete rubric and Figma wireframe, please refer to your course section's Moodle instance. 


## Developer Notes


### Header & Footer

While the header only appears on the landing page, the footer is identical on both pages. 

The hamburger menu in the mobile view does not need to be functional.


### Accordion Component

Upon loading the page, all items in the accordion component should be closed (collapsed). There is one open item in the Figma file for illustrative purposes (i.e. to see what an item should look like when open). 

The full text for the accordion component is available in the provided website-copy.md file. 


### Form Validation States
 
Once the user has interacted with a form field (i.e. they have typed some sort of value and are no longer focused on it), check to see if their input is valid or invalid. This will require conditional selectors.

If their input is invalid, display an exclamation mark in the relevant field. 

If their input is valid, display a check mark in the relevant field. 

Please refer to the Developer Notes in the provided Figma file for visual examples. 


### Horizontal Scroll Component

There are six cards (images and descriptions) provided for the horizontal scroll component. Please duplicate them so that there are twelve in total, giving you enough content to overflow the container.


### Miscellaneous Notes

All scrollbars and checkboxes are for illustrative purposes only. By default, their styles will change based upon the user’s operating system and browser. You do not need to add additional styles to these components. 


### Modal Windows

Three seconds after the user loads the page, the modal window should automatically appear. It should be in a fixed position so that the user must interact with it before engaging with the rest of the page.

The ‘Sign Up Now’ link and the ‘offer details’ link should both take the user to the sign up page.

The ‘Close’ link or button in the upper right-hand corner should dismiss the modal window, letting the user interact with the page once more.
